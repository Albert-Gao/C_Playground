gcc -W -Wall -O2 -ansi -pedantic -g first-program.c -o print-nums

gcc -W -Wall -O2 -ansi -pedantic -g using-math.c -o print-sqrts -lm

1. The flags -W -Wall tell gcc to check for the widest range of possible errors (some checks require optimisation to be turned on). They wonâ€™t stop the program compiling, but they will warn you that something fishy might be going on. 
2. The -g flag includes debugging information in the executable (which could be very useful later). 
3. The -o flag comes before the name of executable file you want to produce.
